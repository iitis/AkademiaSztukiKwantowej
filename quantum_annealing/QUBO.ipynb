    "# Introduction to Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation\n",
    "Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) is a mathematical model used for solving combinatorial optimization problems. As name sugests it is concerned with models where there are quadratic dependencies between variables, there are no constrains and variables are binary. This description encompases suprisingly large class of problems, such as MAX-CUT, traveling salesman or job shob sheduling.  \n",

    "## Definition\n",
    "The QUBO model is expressed by the following optimization problem. Given symmetric matrix $Q$, find binary vector $\\bm{x}^*$ such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\bm{x}^* = \\arg \\min_x \\bm{x}Q\\bm{x}^T = \\sum_i \\sum_j Q_{i,j} x_i x_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common to change the Q matrix into upper triangular form, which can be\n",
    "achieved without loss of generality simply as follows. For all $i$ and $j$ with $j>i$ , replace $Q_{ij}$ by $Q_{ij} + Q_{ji}$ . Then replace all $Q_{ji}$\n",
    "for $j < i$ by 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that for binary variables, $x^2 = x$. This allows us to divide QUBO into linear part on the diagonal and quadratic part:\n",
